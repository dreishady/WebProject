	<h2>The benefits of client side scripting 
	when comparing it to server side scripting.</h2><br>
	
	<p id="client">Scripts are sets of instructions either to the web browser or to the server. 
	There are two forms of scripting; Client-side Scripting and Server-side Scripting. 
	There are a number of systems (client) of which a web browser could run on. 
	However, JavaScript is the core client-side scripting language for a web. 
	The browser interprets client-side scripts. <br>
	By using client-side scripting web pages change as they arrive at the browser making the pages more stimulating and manageable. 
	<br>Client-side scripting is generally used for web pages behavior and look. 
	Client-side scripts directly responds to user’s actions allowing more interactivity. 
	Client-side scripts also work quickly as they do not need to go through a server. 
	<br>Client-side scripting also helps increase the usability of Web sites for users whose browsers support scripts. 
	<br>With client-side scripting, 
	developers are also given more control with the appearance and interactions of their Web widgets. 
	<br>Client-side scripting also does not require the scripting software to be installed in the server. 
	Unlike server-side scripting, 
	client-side scripting’s nature of scripts does not pose a security concern such as hackers gaining access to severs exploiting code flaws.

			<th><span class="web"><h3>*Authentication and Web Security</h3>
		<span style="width:500px;">
	
		Authentication and web security is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' 
		information on a local operating system or within an authentication server. 
		If the credentials match, the process is completed and the user is granted authorization for access.<br>
		So for example, when I browse to a web page, 
		it will redirect my browser to a 'logon service' which it trusts. 
		I will authenticate to that service, 
		and in response it sends back a 'data', which the browser sends back to the web application. 
		Now the web application checks that the data is digitally signed by its trusted logon service, 
		and then looks at the 'security' in the data. Based on those file 
		the application decides the authentication and the security.</th>

		<span class="web"><h3>*Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
		<span style="width:500px;"> 
		
		It is the convention how hypertext transferred in a network.
		A protocol can be defined as a standard set of rules.
		HTTP is a text-based protocol ,a stateless protocol, in which the client sends a request and the server returns a response.
		When you surf the internet and jump from one page to the next you see hypertext in full swing that means 
		you are hypertexting.

		</tr>
		
		<tr>
		<th><br>
		<span class="session"><h3>*Session Management</h3>
		<span style="width:500px;"> 
		
		Because we have HTTP we need to have a session management between the browser side and the server side.
		A session can be defined as a server-side storage of information 
		that is desired to persist throughout the user's interaction with the web site or web application. 
		This session id is passed to the web server every time the browser makes an HTTP request 
		There are some session management that the administrator can use, like cookie based.
		When cookie-based session management is used, 
		a message (cookie) containing user's information is sent to the browser by the web server.
		This cookie is sent back to the server when the user tries to access certain pages. 
		The cookie allows the server to identify the user and retrieve the user's session from the session database,
		so that the user’s session is maintained. A cookie-based session ends when the user logs off or closes the browser.

		<th><br>
		<span class="program"><h3>*Stateless Programming</h3>
		<span style="width:500px;"> 
	
		Stateless means there is no record of previous interactions and each interaction request 
		has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it. 
		Stateless web applications are essential when you start having higher traffic.
		There could be plenty of user data that you don't want to store on the client side for security reasons for example. 
		In this case you need to store it server-side. 
		You could use the web applications default session but if you have more than one instance of the application 
		you will need to make sure that each user is always directed to the same instance.

		<h2> ICT federal and state or territory legislation and policy relating to workplace health safety.</h2>
	
		<p id="whs">
				 Business owners are responsible for health and safety in the workplace. 
				 They must follow the federal and state or territory legislation and policy.
				 Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) involves the assessment and migration of risks that may impact 
				 the health, safety or welfare of those in your workplace. 
				 This may include the health and safety of your customers, employees, visitors, contractors,
				 volunteers and suppliers. 
				 As a business owner there are legal requirements that you must comply with 
				 to ensure your workplace meets WHS obligations.

			There are various health problems associated with the regular use of computers, 
			such as stress, eyestrain and injuries to the wrists, neck and back. Employers must take steps 
			to protect employees whose work involves ICT.<br>
			Many computer users suffer with serious back problems. 
			This is usually due to a poor posture or an awkward position while sitting at a computer. 
			To avoid back pain use a fully adjustable chair, a footrest, use a monitor that is adjustable 
			so that your neck doesn't have to bend. Take regular brakes and walk about. 
			Sit with your back straight and head up. 
			Repetitive strain injury is damage to the fingers, 
			wrist and other parts of the body due to repeated movements over a long period of time. 
			Symptoms include in the arms and hands. Aching, pain in arms/wrists even after rest, 
			weakness, swelling, tenderness, numbness, pins and needles or burning sensation in the shoulders and neck
			<br><br>
			These are some of the things that needs to be done to avoid accidents in a workplace.
			<ul>
			<li> Ensure employees have sufficient breaks.</li>
			<li> Make sure lighting is suitable. </li>
			<li> Provide adjustable chairs. </li>
			<li> Train employees to use stations correctly.</li>
			<li> Make sure there is sufficient space to work. </li>
			<li> Fire exits should be clearly marked.</li>
			<li> Food/drink should not be near machines. </li>
			<li> Fire extinguishers should be available to everyone. </li>
			<li> No electrical sockets overloaded. </li>
			<li> Electrical equipment should be safety tested at least once a year . </li>
			<li> Staff should follow the safety regulations. </li>
			<li> Etc. </li>
